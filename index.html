                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>The concept of <strong>The Force</strong> is simply described as the energy that sorrounds everything. Every single piece of the whole Universe is related somehow to it. Certain entities (mostly creatures) are sensitive to The Force and can react to its influence, even by learning to control it. Some organizations based on The Force, like the Jedi and the Sith, tend to look for these special beings and train them. Manipuling The Force provides a huge (almost infinite) set of special skills to the one who can do it, like controlling objects without touch them, move faster, jump higher, trick others minds, create lightnings and even search in the past and the future. Many Force sensitive creatures can sense how other beings feel and understand them without the need of a language. This includes animals.</p>
                    <p>Those who control The Force and deliberately use it for following their purposes are known as <strong>Force Users</strong>. This material focuses on those entities. Some of them have become so powerfull through The Force that have ruled the galaxy, devoured whole planets, influenced in thousands of minds to avoid conflicts and even created and destroyed life.</p>

                                    <h3>Meditation</h3>
                                    <p>When meditating, Force Users normally get (for short periods of time) their maximun potential. It is said that a Force User becomes 'one with The Force' when meditating, and many times, when the conexion is finally broken, they can not remember anything. Legendary Jedis like <strong>Yoda</strong> are known for being able to sense almost the whole universe when meditating. Other Jedis, like <strong>Bastilla</strong>, were capable to unleash tremendous power only during meditation state.</p>

                                    <p>Force Users trainings depend a lot in the use they are going to give to The Force. <strong>Jedi</strong>, focused in using it for good and peace, base their lernings in balance and comunion with nature forces. Dimplomacy is a normal skill found in most Jedi. It is well known the amount of war Jedi have helped to avoid. <strong>Sith</strong>, on the contrary, base their Force trainings in chaos and aggression. Many abilities related to Siths are known for hurting (or killing) people. Siths are masters of manipulation, and their actions have historicaly leaded to huge wars.</p>

                                    <p>One of the most powerful members of the Sith order was <strong>Darth Sidious</strong>. Originary from Naboo, this dimplomat was responsible for various of the most amazing facts related to Siths manipulations, ever. He ruled the galaxy for more than twenty years, created his own Galactic Empire, exterminated the Jedi Order almost completely and took as apprendice the Sith Lord that killed the biggest amount of Jedi in the whole history: <strong>Darth Vader</strong>. To this date, it is still unclear how far his powers were, but immortability and the ability to destroy life itself were just two of his common arsenal. In order to destroy him once and for all, one of the strongest Jedi ever, <strong>Luke Skywalker</strong>, had to fall voluntarily to the Dark Side.</p>

                    <p>In <strong>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</strong>, an unexpected twist showed how Jedi Master <strong>Qui-Gon Jinn</strong> was able to measure the amount of Force in one subject (Anakin Skywalker) using his blood. The measurement unit was called <strong>midiclorian</strong>. Many fans were not happy with this.</p>
